## Description
This website is designed to promote yoga, body and mind training, and fitness, catering to both men and women. It aims to provide valuable information about the benefits of yoga and encourage a healthy lifestyle through regular practice.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to design and develop this website. I used the wireframe tools to visualise my ideas and create the fundamental structural layouts for this website.
