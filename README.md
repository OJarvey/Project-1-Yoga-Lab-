## Description
This website is designed to promote yoga, body and mind training, and fitness, catering to both men and women. It aims to provide valuable information about the benefits of yoga and encourage a healthy lifestyle through regular practice.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to design and develop this website. I used the wireframe tools to visualise my ideas and create the fundamental structural layouts for this website.

The website closely adheres to the original wireframe plan, ensuring that the design closely aligns with the initial conceptualization. This approach emphasizes consistency between the envisioned layout and the final implementation of the website.

 # Bugs

 - Hero image did not work, I resolved this by using the <img src=""> which fixed it.

 - Menu was not responsive when switched to tablet screens, resolved by changing to display: block.
 - Video on home page was not responsive on smaller screens, resolved by changing the max-width: 100% and height: auto.
